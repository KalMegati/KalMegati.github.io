Theatre.


### Blocking

Know the geography of the stage, and how to use location to enhance presentation.

### Improv

Explore before refining.

### Voice

I fight for the users.

The character's voice is important by concept.

But it is just as impossible to remove the actor's voice. An excellent performance is just as much the work of the actor's portrayal as it is the character's writing, even if this is not so visible to the audience.

Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, David Tennant's Hamlet, and Ethan Hawke's Hamlet (yeah I saw that one too) are all largely informed by the actors that portray them.

So what is my voice, or perhaps my sight, for as a colorblind coder?

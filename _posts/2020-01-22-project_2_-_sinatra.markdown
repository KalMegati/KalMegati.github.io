FEATURE CREEP

Traditionally this is broken into Fantasy and Science Fiction. Well I've done my fantasy app. Obviously the next step would be the SciFi app.

Command Line Interface is inherently a more solitary system.

This was also before propogation and storage of data in databases.

WEB DESIGN

A disclaimer for the entirety of this section: I have done pretty much no research on practices for aesthetic web design. Everything that is about to follow is 

Corneal provides a neat prepackaged layout.erb view to serve and a header and footer for 

UNFINISHED EDGES

Characters and Locations have a Story and Image attribute that a Writer can fill on Create or Update, but there is no actual view to Read this information. These are 

OFF GRID

To this end, I was working 

It's a strange place to consider yourself "off the grid"

For that matter, there probably is a "waiting room wifi" that I could have accessed, perhaps I just needed to ask someone. In fact, as I'm writing this a part of me is convinced that the wifi instructions were sitting on a wall somewhere. Perhaps directly behind my seat for maximum irony. Or maybe directly in front of my seat for...also maximum irony.

But it was in that git-deprived moment that I had placed myself, working on my project while my car was tended to. This particular coding session revolved around my Location and Character objects.



ACTIVATION ENERGY

I studied Chemical Engineering at college, so give me a bit as I move to a different field of analogies.


Imagine a ball at a position like 

Naturally, this begs the question

And here is where I can bring us back to coding, because this is largely related to the usefulness of GitHub.

Working on my Ruby CLI I maintained a strict protocol: `git add .` > `git commit -m` > `git push`

Working on The Usual Spot has been considerably different.

I tend to pile up multiple commits
